This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the suitability of candidates for job positions based on their resumes. The project involves preprocessing resumes, training a model on labeled data, and evaluating the model's performance on a test set.

# Project_Overview
The primary objective of this project is to accurately predict whether a candidate is suitable for a job position based on their resume. The workflow includes converting resumes from Word format to PDF, extracting relevant features, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.

# Installation
User must have proper jupyter notebook environment installed on device, can refer anaconda navigator for that. Some standard libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, pandas etc. must be installed on jupyter notebook to run the model effectively. Some models like XgBoost, LightGBM etc are used in this model.

# Features
Model extracts only relevant data from cv of candidate, preprocess it according the model and predicts whether candidate is  suitable for the job or not according to job profile.
